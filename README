This repository is unofficial forked one from linux kernel.
It include some modified for scalability in memory system.
We called LDU(Log-based Deferred Update).

We propose a novel light weight concurrent update method, LDU, to improve performance scalability for Linux kernel on many-core systems through eliminating lock contentions for update-heavy global data structures during process spawning and optimizing update logs. The proposed LDU is implemented into Linux kernel 4.5-rc6 and evaluated using representative benchmark programs. Our evaluation reveals that the Linux kernel with LDU shows performance improvement by ranging from 1.2x through 2.2x on a 120 core system.
